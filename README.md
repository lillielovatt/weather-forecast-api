**Front Page** When you first access the weather dashboard, it is empty--just waiting for your first request! Enter a valid city name and see what weather awaits you. (Don't worry if you can't think of a valid city name; we all have those days, and there's a safety net for that.)

**First Search** Hooray! There's the weather forecast for your first search--including the temperature, wind speed, humidity, UV index (now, color-coded!), and a handy icon for those of us who just like a good picture. Below is the 5 day forecast.

**Many Searches Later...** Look at all those searches! When a valid city name is searched, it's added to your history tab--and you can ask for the weather for that city again with just a click of the button with the city's name (it's not really a *button*, but hey! It looks just like one). Now, go test it out! If it's raining tomorrow, maybe you should stay in...and code. Just a thought.
